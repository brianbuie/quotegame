Oh, yes, I did."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim’s desk while he’s away in Philly.

Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.” Wow."}],[{"character":"Clark","quote":"You know what, man? I deserve this job."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Mm-hmm."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond… and under."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"You know what? You’re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you’re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Clark has no chance. I mean, he’s up against my buddy Rolf, for God’s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he’ll make you laugh so hard, you’ll puke your pants."}],[{"character":"Clark","quote":"This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"You could’ve just called that an alliance too, right?"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I chose my words very carefully."}],[{"character":"Jim","quote":"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that’s only gonna make things worse."}],[{"character":"Clark","quote":"[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?"},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"No. You’re interviewing for it. I’m getting it."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Well, I wouldn’t be so sure about that. I mean, I’ve been working here 12 weeks. That’s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we’ve seen."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"I’m Rolf. Rolf Ahl."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"Go to hell."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"There he is."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let’s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don’t compare. When you’re with the R-O-L-F, you’re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]"},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"Nice."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy."}],[{"character":"Pam","quote":"When are you talking to David Wallace?"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I’m talking to him this afternoon, but don’t get your hopes up."},{"character":"Pam","quote":"Too late. My hopes are up."}],[{"character":"Jim","quote":"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we’re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I’m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So… problem solved. Thanks, guys."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"And this chair’s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I’m on the phone.

Doesn’t matter."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"So I’ve got your resume here, but it’s not telling me everything."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you’re qualified to evaluate me?"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Well, I’m the one offering the job."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"What are your credentials?"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I’ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I’m an Assistant to the Regional Manager."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"I think I’ve heard everything I need to hear."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I’m sure he’d give a reference."},{"character":"Rolf","quote":"Thank you, Dwight. I’ll be in touch."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Well, they can’t all be winners. But Trevor’s next and he’s a real professional. You say, “Jump,” and he says, “Oh who?” He loves to jump on people, that Trevor."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"What makes you think you’d be an effective paper salesman?"},{"character":"Trevor","quote":"Ooh, okay. Didn’t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Well, it’s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."},{"character":"Trevor","quote":"Pass. Next one."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?"},{"character":"Trevor","quote":"No, no and no."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"There were only two options."},{"character":"Trevor","quote":"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend.

You—you sure it’s okay? ‘Cause you’re kinda—"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You’re clean, right?"},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Oh, Dove Men."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don’t listen to it at all because we’re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—"},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Thanks, dude."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Why?"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I need you to breathe in my face right now."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"[exhales]"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?"},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Wintergreen."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I knew it, I knew it."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Yeah, good nose."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I looked at you coming around, and I said, “Wintergreen.”"}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I can’t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Okay, here’s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can’t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"That’s just a classic no-win situation."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Thank you."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"So I’d Kobayashi Maru it."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Damn it!

Star Trek rules."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"It does, but still no."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Oh, you think they’re my only friends? I’ve got way more friends than that, and they’re all better than the losers who work here."}],[{"character":"Stanley","quote":"This is not natural."}],[{"character":"Oscar","quote":"Just – I don’t wanna make assumptions based on people’s physical appearances."},{"character":"Pam","quote":"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?"},{"character":"Darryl","quote":"They smell so bad."},{"character":"Meredith","quote":"If I ever get that bad, you’d tell me, right?"},{"character":"Kevin","quote":"Meredith, I tell you all the time."},{"character":"Meredith","quote":"[chuckles] Walked right into that one."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He’s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I’ve got big expectations, Mose-wise."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"What quality would make you a good sales associate?"},{"character":"Mose","quote":"People person."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical."},{"character":"Mose","quote":"That’s right."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"You know we live together, right?"},{"character":"Mose","quote":"Yes."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"And I’ve never seen you go to work, ever."},{"character":"Mose","quote":"Okay."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"So why is this on your resume?

It’s a cow shower, so there’s like, a ton of people in there."},{"character":"Clark","quote":"So you guys all know Dwight already?"},{"character":"Melvina","quote":"I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby."},{"character":"Gabor","quote":"I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school."},{"character":"Melvina","quote":"You went to X-Men school too? [exhales]"},{"character":"Clark","quote":"X-Men school?"}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out."}],[{"character":"Gabor","quote":"Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi’s. A lot of telemarketing."}],[{"character":"Angela","quote":"I don’t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something."},{"character":"Stanley","quote":"I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn’t work then. And now look what he’s doing to us."},{"character":"Nellie","quote":"Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"How is it my fault?"},{"character":"Nellie","quote":"Here’s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"But it’s Dwight who’s bring in all the weirdos."},{"character":"Oscar","quote":"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight’s a weirdo. We can’t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos."},{"character":"Pam","quote":"Hey, I’m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim’s away. I’m in a position where I’m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off."}],[{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don’t lie. I can tell if you’re lying."},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Hey, Dwight. It’s David."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"David."},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Jim says he’d like some say in the hiring process."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Really? That’s interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who’s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—"},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Oh. Um…"},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Yeah."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Okay. I can’t say that that’s not fair."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Sounds fair to me, David."},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"And I know we have a call scheduled for later –"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Oh, yeah, so we’ll just do that later."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"No. Why not do it now?"},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Yeah. What’s up Jim?"},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Uh… [clears throat] Well, it’s about Athlead. I’m sorry.

Go ahead, Jim."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"There’s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –"},{"character":"David Wallace","quote":"Okay.

Like bread."}],[{"character":"Jim","quote":"Dwight, you can’t just hire someone ‘cause they’re your friend."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I’m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend."},{"character":"Nellie","quote":"They’re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero."},{"character":"Darryl","quote":"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating."}],[{"character":"Wolf","quote":"Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch."}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range.

Watch this."},{"character":"Wolf","quote":"Do you want this paper?"},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I sure do."},{"character":"Wolf","quote":"It’s not very good."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"I will pay you whatever it takes."},{"character":"Wolf","quote":"I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money."},{"character":"Wolf","quote":"Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It’s over."},{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow.

[chuckles]"}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He’s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I’m hesitant. Why can’t I pull the trigger on any of them?"}],[{"character":"Dwight","quote":"[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.

They tow after about 45 minutes."},{"character":"Melvina","quote":"Well, the joke’s on them. I live right next to the tow yard.

Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around."},{"character":"Jim","quote":"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I’m not looking south, I’m not livin’.
